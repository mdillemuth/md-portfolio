## Description

This website was developed in React and bootstrapped with _Create React App_. The app followed a design and style guide provided by _Frontendmentor.io_. Design assets were provided in _Figma_.

The site hosts personal information and a thorough showcase of my personal projects. The goal for this project was to create a scalable and maintainable portfolio website that could easily accomdate implementing new feature and new projects.

## Technologies

- React
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Figma
- Netlify

## Key Features

- Responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Animation and transitions between components with _react-transition-group_ and _react-router-hash-link_
- Dynamically rendered components for the portfolio projects
- Contact form with client-side validation implemented with _Formik_ and _Netlify_
- Clean and elegant design

## Style Implementation

The project consists of a series of CSS files that correspond with the React components. The styling was written in plain CSS and does not rely on a library such as Bootstrap.

### React Libraries

- _react-router-dom_ for client-side routing
- _react-router-hash-link_ for the scrolling effect noticed from clicking the navigation links
- _react-transition-group_ for the fade-out and fade-in effect when switching between components
- _formik_ for the contact form and it's client-side validation
- _react-burger-menu_ for the mobile navigation menu and its animation effect
- _react-modal_ for the demo gif displayed in an individual project component ('Show Demo' button)
