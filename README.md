# mdillemuth-personal-portfolio

This repository is source for my live personal portfolio, mattdillemuth.com

This is a solo-project that is built with pure HTML & CSS. 

Key features include mobile-first responsive design, implementation of UI fundamentals, and the use of SASS as a CSS pre-processor. 

My goals are to periodically update the website with my personal projects as they become available for display. Further, I intend to implement JavaScript to create a more interactive and experience for the user.
