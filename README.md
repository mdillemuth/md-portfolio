# Personal Portfolio Website

This project is a portfolio I designed and built for myself. The purpose is to clearly display projects and provide an effective contact method. 

## Motivation

The site is a fluid project that will frequently be updated with new content. As my skill and knowledge of development grows I will be able to implement more complex features and interactivity.
